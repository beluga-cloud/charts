## [Cert Manager Issuers](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager)

> _Warning: This application requires [`cert-manager`](https://cert-manager.io/)._

`Issuers`, and `ClusterIssuers`, are Kubernetes resources that represent certificate authorities (CAs) that are able to
generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests. All cert-manager certificates require a
referenced issuer that is in a ready condition to attempt to honor the request.

[Overview of cert-manager issuers](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/)

## TL;DR

```shell
helm repo add belug-apps https://belug-apps.github.io/catalog
helm install my-release belug-apps/cert-manager-issuers
```

## Introduction

This chart helps to configure `Issuers` and `ClusterIssuers` using the [Helm](helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes >= 1.20.0-0
- Helm 3+
- `cert-manager` <no value>

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```shell
helm repo add belug-apps https://belug-apps.github.io/catalog
helm install my-release belug-apps/cert-manager-issuers
```

These commands deploy cert-manager-issuers on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration.
The Parameters section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip:** List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```shell
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

Listing all parameters here didn't make sense; each issuer follows the same structure:
```yaml
<issuer-type>:
  - name: <issuer-name>:
    metadata:
      annotations: {} # (Optional) additional annotations
      labels: {} # (Optional) additional labels
    spec: {} # Issuer configuration (using the same pattern as used inside the issuer CRD)
             # NOTE: template are allowed here. However, only two value are provided:
             # - issuer.name - contains the issuer name
             # - issuer.namespace - contains the issuer namespace
             # - credentials.name - contains the secret name containing credentials
             # - credentials.namespace - contains the secret namespace containing credentials
    credentials: {} # (Optional) create a secret used to store credentials
```

For example, a `ClusterIssuer` configured to used Cloudflare as DNS resolver
```yaml
clusterIssuer:
  - name: letsencrypt:
    spec:
      acme:
        email: user@example.com
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        solvers:
          - selector:
              dnsZones: [example.com]
            dns01:
              cloudflare:
                apiTokenSecretRef:
                  name: '{{ .credentials.name }}'
                  key: api-token
        privateKeySecretRef:
          name: '{{ .credentials.name }}-issuer-key'
    credentials:
      api-token: CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN
```

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```shell
helm install my-release --set fullnameOverride=my-cert-manager-issuers belug-apps/cert-manager-issuers
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```shell
helm install my-release -f values.yaml my-repo/cert-manager-issuers
```

> **Tip:** You can use the default values.yaml
