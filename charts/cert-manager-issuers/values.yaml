# each issuer follows the same structure:
#  issuer-type:
#    issuer-name:
#      metadata:
#        annotations: {} # (Optional) additional annotations
#        labels: {} # (Optional) additional labels
#      spec: {} # Issuer configuration (using the same pattern as used inside the issuer CRD)
#      NOTE: template are allowed here. However, only two value are provided:
#      - credentials.name - contains the secret name containing credentials
#      - credentials.namespace - contains the secret namespace containing credentials
#      credentials: {} # (Optional) create a secret used to store credentials
#
# e.g. cluster issuer configured to used Cloudflare as DNS resolver
#  acme:
#    letsencrypt:
#      spec:
#        email: user@example.com
#        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
#        solvers:
#          - selector:
#              dnsZones: [example.com]
