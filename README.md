## Description

This repository contains all Helm charts that I use personally and that I maintain.  
_Why maintaining these charts_ will you ask ? There is several reasons:

- Some charts made by the community are not what I expect of the usage of Helm.
    - For example, I don't want to have a sort of "generic engine" where every chart must use a common Helm library
      that could handle everything, and we just need to configure the `values.yaml` (
      like [TrueCharts](https://github.com/truecharts/charts) or [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home)).  
      I can understand this choice with the number of charts that they maintain, but I found that really hard to edit
      and to create a new chart.
- I would use this repository as a sandbox to test new features or to try new things, like signing the Helm charts or
  adding some security checks.
- It's fun for me to spend time trying to do my best to make the best charts possible _(best... for me ðŸ˜…)_.

## Usage

```shell
helm repo add belug-apps https://belug-apps.github.io/catalog
helm install my-release belug-apps/<chart>
```

> All charts documentation are available in the `charts/<chart>/README.md` file or
> on [artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?page=1&ts_query_web=belug-apps).
